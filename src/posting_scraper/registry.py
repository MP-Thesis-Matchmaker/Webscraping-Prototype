"""Registry + state.

The *registry* is the immutable, human-authored source of truth
(`registry/scraping_sources.json`): 37 units across 7 faculties, 103 thesis
sources (106 URLs — a few sources bundle two). The *state* (`var/state.json`) is
the mutable per-source bookkeeping — onboarding status and per-run progress —
that makes pause/resume possible. Both live here so every other stage has a
single place to ask "what sources exist and where are they in their lifecycle?".

Both file locations come from `config.Settings` (`registry_path`, `state_path`), so
pointing `SCRAPER_DATA_ROOT` at another tree moves them together.
