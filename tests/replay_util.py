"""Shared helper for the contract-replay tests (`test_contracts.py`).

The spec engine is deterministic: a frozen `snapshot.html` (or `snapshot.json`)
plus a `spec.yaml` must always yield the same records, with no network. This
module replays that offline extraction and compares it to a committed golden
baseline (`tests/golden_contracts.json`).

Why a golden baseline and not the contracts' own `expected.json`? `expected.json`
is frozen once during onboarding and additionally carries *enrichment* (followed
profiles, PDF-parsed supervisors) that is not reproducible offline — and some
specs/snapshots were edited after their `expected.json` was written. The golden
file captures exactly what the current engine extracts offline from each
snapshot, so the test guards against future *regressions* in the engine and
specs. Regenerate it deliberately (after an intended change) with:

    python tests/regen_golden.py

Only the deterministic, offline-reproducible part of a contract is replayed:
topics/people specs (including `grouped_people`, `sectioned_people`, and `json`
sources). Process pages (LLM summaries) and link/PDF enrichment need the network
and are out of scope for this offline replay.
